Face liveness detection is an advanced research topic nowadays due to its significant security applications in various fields. The spoofing problem is a threat to security of the face recognition systems and it can be minimized by detecting the face liveness. 
three types of such spoofing attacks have been used in the past, to varying degrees of success:
(i) still-image-based spoofing, 
(ii) video-based spoofing,
and (iii) 3D-mask-based spoofing. 
As the name suggests, still-image-based spoofing attacks present one or more still images of the user to the authentication camera; each
image is either printed on paper or shown with a digitized display. 
Video-based spoofing, on the other hand,presents a pre-recorded video of the victimâ€™s moving face in an attempt to trick the system into falsely recognizing motion as an indication of liveness. 
The 3D-mask-based approach, wherein 3D-printed facial masks are used.
